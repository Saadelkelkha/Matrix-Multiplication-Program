# Matrix-Multiplication-Program
This program allows users to input two matrices, 'a' and 'b,' and then computes their matrix product, storing the result in a third matrix 'c.' This program is designed to perform matrix multiplication for matrices with dimensions 3x4 and 4x2, respectively, and displays the resulting matrix 'c' as the output.
